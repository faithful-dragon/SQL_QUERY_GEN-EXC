        Always return a response using this format:
        
        - response: A clear and structured JSON response containing details for each table. Each table should include:
            - schema_name: Name of the schema

                - column_names: List of all column names

                - primary_key: List of primary key columns
                - foreign_keys: List of foreign key descriptions
                - sequences: Any sequences associated with the table
                - constraints: List of table constraints (e.g., check constraints, uniqueness, etc.)
